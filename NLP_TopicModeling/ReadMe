This project was used to create a taxonomy of job titles related to "data scientist" and to determine potential equivalent classes,
similar titles and sub-domains. The results indicated four titles including data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, and
machine learning engineer. ML engineer was clearly the most distinct category. While data engineer was the most fragmented between 
other classes. Analyst, was also fairly distinguishable although the Data Scientist title indicated similarity with analyst and 
machine learning. It also appears that big data is also somewhat distinguishable from other analyst roles.

1. indeed_webscrapping provides the python code for scrapping indeed using beautiful soup without access to the API. API access could be
simpler for querying titles but requires approval.
2. jobopenings.json provides around 1,000 job openings scrapped from indeed with the titles mentioned previously. 
3. indeed_doc_classification.ipynb. Provides the NLP model code including TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, NMF, LDA and topic visualizations. TF-IDF 
worked well for this task, although both NMF and LDA also provided useful insight.
