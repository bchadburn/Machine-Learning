This project was used to create a taxonomy of job titles related to "data scientist" and to determine potential equivalent classes,
similar titles and sub-domains. The results indicated four titles including data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, and
machine learning engineer. ML engineer was clearly the most distinct category. While data engineer was the most fragmented between 
other classes. Analyst, was also fairly distinguishable although the Data Scientist title indicated similarity with analyst and 
machine learning. It also appears that big data is also somewhat distinguishable from other analyst roles.
