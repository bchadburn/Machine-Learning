The folder "Linear Regression includes several different type of linear regressions conducted in R programming. These include GLM, Logistic Regression, "Predicting House Prices" using GLM but with 80 variables to sort through, Regression with PCA transformation, and the model "poisson_negative_binomial_ZIP". Most of these are self-explanatory, the last one is for models trying to predict values where zero values are common and so Poisson, Negative Binomial, as well as a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model to compary model performances.

"Chicago_Food_Inspection" (PYTHON) uses elastic search to query the chicago food inspection data set using NoSQL database engine ElasticSearch for indiexing and data retrieval. Use heatmap to plot the geolocations of the facilities that failed Chicago food inspections.

"NLP_RNN" (PYTHON) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) using TensorFlow for natural language proceesing (NLP). The model uses GloVe to represent words as neural network embeddings to assist with deriving word meaning and use. This is the one assignment provided on github, where the template code makes up the majority of the code as the process is quite lengthly. However, I was required created two alternative RNN structures and performed hyperparameter testing. Using starter code as template, I then created four seperate
language models.

"Random_Forests" uses random forests techniques to predict Boston Housing prices. Extra trees regressor, Ridge Regression, linear regression, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging Regressor are all used to make predictions and then using k-fold cross-validation their performance was compared using mean squared error (MSE). 

The file "logistic classifier bank" (python) uses naive bayes and logistic regression classifiers and uses k-fold cross validation.
